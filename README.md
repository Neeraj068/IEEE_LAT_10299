The antenna introduces a novel 12-element MIMO antenna with an integrated self-triplexing system using a substrate-integrated waveguide for advanced wireless communication services. This antenna comprises 12-stepped shaped radiators within a SIW square cavity, each with an individual 50Ω inset-fed line to excite its corresponding radiator. 12-radiators are arranged into three groups with different radiator sizes to achieve self-triplexing operation. Each group contains four identical radiating elements to function as a MIMO antenna system. The proposed integrated MIMO antenna triplexer operates at three distinct frequencies: 4.49 GHz, 6 GHz, and 6.72 GHz, respectively. The antenna is fabricated on a single-layer substrate to validate its performance. The mutual coupling among any radiator is maintained at less than -22.5 dB within the -10 dB impedance bandwidth (IBW). The gain of the proposed antenna is 4.11 dBi, 4.93 dBi, and 6.20 dBi at the respective frequencies. The proposed antenna has an envelope correlation coefficient (ECC) of less than 0.03 at 4.49 GHz, 0.002 at 6 GHz, and 6.72 GHz, with a diversity gain of more than 9.99 dB across all bands. This antenna eliminates the need for additional signal-separation circuits in multi-band MIMO systems due to its inherent band-separation capability.

• The antenna comprises 12-stepped shaped radiators within a SIW square cavity. Each radiator is backed by a sub-quarter-mode cavity and excited by 50Ω inset-fed lines. 

• All the radiators are arranged into three groups with different radiator sizes to achieve self-triplexing operation. Each group contains four identical radiating elements to function as a MIMO antenna system. 

• It provides high gain, low mutual coupling, and low ECC, along with a directed radiation pattern and self-shielding using cavity-supported stepped radiators on SIW cavities. 

• This antenna can effectively reduce multipath and intermodal interference, while also offering a wide range of frequency tuning capabilities. 

Applications of the proposed antenna: The proposed antenna is a strong candidate for applications in next-generation WLAN, vehicular technology, UAVs, and Super Extended C-band communications.
